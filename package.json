  "description": "This branch is a complete rewrite of CYMK. There are several goals behind the rewrite, but the primary goal is to make the interface as snappy as possible. We are moving away from a Rails application and using Sinatra, and the services are rewritten to use threads cleanly. This rewrite also returns us to CoreAudio for complete control over audio (although VLC is still supported).",
